    "missed_elements": ["list of important information from English that is missing in Chinese"],
    "added_elements": ["list of information in Chinese that was not present in English"],
    "wrong_translations": ["incorrect word/phrase -> correct translation", ...],
    "grammar_errors": ["specific grammatical mistakes in the Chinese translation"],
    "style_issues": ["problems with register, tone, or appropriateness"],
    "cultural_adaptation": <float 0-10>,
    "fluency": <float 0-10>,
    "accuracy": <float 0-10>,
    "reasoning": "detailed explanation of your evaluation focusing on the most significant issues"
}}, ...
